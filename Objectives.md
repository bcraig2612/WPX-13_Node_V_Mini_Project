# BCRYPT DAY!

**Objectives:** 

- (1) Student can discuss basics of web based authentication.

- (2) Student can use bcrypt to hash and store passwords.

- (3) Student can use bcrypt to authenticate users.

- (4) Student can describe the differences between Hashing, Encryption and Encoding.

**Authentication:**

- the process or action of proving or showing something to be true, genuine, or valid.

**Encoding:**

- convert into a coded form, easily undone, typically to be used to allow info to be consumed by different systems.

**Encryption:**

- a way of encoding a message or information in such a way that only authorized parties can access it and those who are not authorized cannot.

**Hashing:**

- is a specific type of message authentication code (MAC) involving a cryptographic hash function and a secret cryptographic key.

**Salt:**

- In password protection, salt is a random string of data used to modify a password hash. Salt can be added to the hash to prevent a collision by uniquely identifying a user's password, even if another user in the system has selected the same password. Salt can also be added to make it more difficult for an attacker to break into a system by using password hash-matching strategies because adding salt to a password hash prevents an attacker from testing known dictionary words across the entire system.
